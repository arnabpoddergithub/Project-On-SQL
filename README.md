# Project-On-SQL
The challenge contains 20 analytics questions to be answered with SQL (I used PostgreSQL). The dataset contains information about Olympics games for about 120 years. The datasets were downloaded at Kaggle.

The file athlete_events.csv contains 271116 rows and 15 columns. Each row corresponds to an individual athlete competing in an individual Olympic event (athlete-events).
